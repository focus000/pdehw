# PDE Solutions

I'm learning pde and considering study in this field.

This is the place that I solve problems in some classical pde books, but I want to see more different solutions, and learn more different methods, think from different ways, and the most important is learn from each others mistakes. Hence, I'd like to see more people as the same purpose as me and join me to update this solutions.

At this moment I just consider give solutions in G-T book and some problems from my pde teacher.

For improve efficiency and reduce conflict as much as possible, we need a rule to standardized the coding style, writing style and etc.

Welcome to fork me, and expect your PR!
